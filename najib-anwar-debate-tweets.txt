1525202336280637440,@khalidkarim I believe decision was made during DS Najib as PM because in the debate, Anwar did mention that. Yg sy pelik adalah, kenapa DS Najib beria2 nak bailout Sapura? Pertama kali berjaya guna PNB. Kali kedua pula nak guna Petronas. Mcm ada hidden agenda.

1525057685720211457,@trialandarrows @mZmZperle @macfaisal @NoreenHadzim Basically the whole debate was a platform to show who won this ‚Äúpopularity‚Äù contest. Yet no one gives proper solution. Heck najib suggesting petronas bailout, and anwar, same with the rhetorics. Both not suitable to be PM
----------
1525054556505522176,The entire debate, Anwar was trying to bring the narrative of elites versus commoners, trying to look like people's champions. But then, most of his words are just him questioning every solution from Najib, but none came from his side as a better counter.

1525049881836285952,@teresakok @anwaribrahim Or is Anwar double face? Is Anwar having deal to help Najib to return as he has deal with Zahid?

1525038203731791872,Just started watching the debate between Anwar and Najib on YouTube. I totally agree with Anwar that a forensic audit must be establish in the case of Sapura Energy. I find Najib ambitious argument not convincing enough as Sapura Energy has corporate governance issue.
----------
1525037236844376064,Dalam aku kebuntuan melihat Notion deck project aku,

I look debate as to perform your level of understanding and analyze the issues, kedua-dua cover point yang vital.

1525034821210492928,I think an article of metadiscourse analysis on Anwar - Najib debate will be published next year judging by how so many people on Twitter analyse the face off from different angles ü§£
----------
1525028004925124608,Yet to watch Anwar vs Najib debate. One of the topic is Sapura Energy. Became a political topic since PNB owns up to 40% of Sapura after purchasing a worth of RM 4 billion Sapura Energy right issue shares in 2018.
----------
1525023750789337088,Unpopular opinion based on debate.

Najib - Progressive. Eager to look Malaysia maju. Visionary.

Anwar - Transparent. Eager to look Malaysia bebas dari korup. Justice.

If I can choose, I would love to see Najib-Anwar become PM &amp; DPM.
----------
1525012677634199553,Najib didn't win in the debate from my view, but he didn't fail.
On the other hand, Anwar failed because he didn't win in the debate. 

The situation doesn't change, Najib still as the Boss of those naive or corrupted ppl. Anwar didn't get anything through this debate.
----------
1525011277944279040,However the debate is fun to watch, i like the way they talked to each other especially Najib, jelas. For Anwar ada main emotion sikit but still loud and clear speaker üîä
----------
1525010337908461569,Yeah i agreed Anwar didn‚Äôt do his homework for debate, but did he talking bullshit? No. Najib fared better than Anwar in debate but does he deserve the applause? Absolutely no because what he said is totally manipulative plus does not apply with his action.
----------
1525009310329499649,@AdibBusku @muhdrajaei @QiBreezy I know Anwar been challenging Najib for debate for quite sometime but I still do not see the value of it doing it now against a guy who is not even holding any ministerial position in the current govt, some more a convicted criminal. It only makes sense if Najib is still PM.
----------
1525008177598963712,didnt watch the anwar najib debate i just wanna know did they kiss it out by the end of it?

1525007046055436288,@muhdrajaei @zimgodo @QiBreezy Pretty common among non-politically conscious people or perhaps newbies. Anwar has been challenging Najib on a debate for more than 10 yrs kot and Najib dismissed. The difference this time is Najib bring Anwar in

1524999535269117953,How I see the debate. It doesn't matter who presented the better argument -- that was always secondary. Main gain for both Anwar and Najib is that they can now go back to their respective vote bases and claim the win. Anwar can spin tales of leadership, while Najib of relevance.

----------
1524986999362375685,@FreeMsian Personally, I prefer the original Rafizi-Najib debate plan
Anwar made solid points n at times slam dunked on Najib but was still diplomatic, not too aggressive in refuting Najib‚Äôs points

Rafizi however would go for a precision kill

1524982333937397761,@Darvinnnnnnn I didnt see a clear winner whatsoever for the debate, felt like both of them got valid points, with Najib talking about stats and data, whilst Anwar talk about forensic audit. Both are two important things, cant audit without facts.

We are so fucked...    

#AnwarVSNajib #CashIsKing

Anwar lost the debate on top of losing the game! He legitimatises a convict!
----------
1524944793671200768,How to talk like BN 'centrist' 101:
1. Declare that both Najib &amp; Anwar is bad, but Najib better.
2. Say that both has poor points, but Najib is better.
3. Would not want both to be PM, but Najib is better.
4. Thought Anwar is good in debate, but Najib is better.
----------
1524944019683684352,@malaysiakini Anwar gave Najib the national platform and this already a major strategic error. No matter what Najib said, by appearing rationale and caring, Anwar helps Najib to win over voters in Sapura, PNB, GLCs and rural areas to BN! A real stupid move to debate a criminal!

1524912289039536128,@teresakok @anwaribrahim No... Najib personally won coz Anwar gave him a chance to be in national limelight again ignoring the facts that he has been convicted. Najib is craving for publicity and media coverage, Anwar gave it in silver platter.

----------
1524814983334449160,My take on Najib Anwar Debate :

Najib mcm CEO yg tengah ‚Äúsedap‚Äù. Aggressive nak besarkan company. Spend duit , get more revenue, besarkan company . Untung 

Anwar typical CFO yg sentiasa kawal akaun .Nk belanja kena betul2 plan.Tak boleh spend byk2.Nanti tak Lepas audit.

1525250722459451393,@MsiaChronicle No doubt Anwar did better than Najib..only the known prof kangkong Azmi Hassan says anwar did not prepare for debate..we know who Azmi kankong  is..
----------
1525202336280637440,@khalidkarim I believe decision was made during DS Najib as PM because in the debate, Anwar did mention that. Yg sy pelik adalah, kenapa DS Najib beria2 nak bailout Sapura? Pertama kali berjaya guna PNB. Kali kedua pula nak guna Petronas. Mcm ada hidden agenda.
----------
1525148923719208960,@chairman_GLC Dgn Anwar najib blh calling2 dn side deal sb najib tau Anwar is leaving his option open utk deal lps pru15 thus kita lihat debate smlm hnya wayang. No real punch frm Anwar. Tp dgn RR najib will never agree to face off. Kn kepit kuat2.
----------
1525131437640364032,Anwar - Najib debate ni aku xfollow langsung. Harini baru tahu ada debate. Tapi tulah, pembangkang duk canang, Najib penjenayah, banduan, patut kena penjara.

1525104402352066563,Regardless of your feelings about yesterday's debate between Anwar and Najib. Both are neoliberal, with little to offer the proletariat class. So, why should I bother with it in the first place?
----------
1525103108233211905,But the real best result is we take things step by step. All in all, kudos to both Dato Seri Anwar and DS Najib. This debate poke the critical issues in our country.

----------
1525057685720211457,@trialandarrows @mZmZperle @macfaisal @NoreenHadzim Basically the whole debate was a platform to show who won this ‚Äúpopularity‚Äù contest. Yet no one gives proper solution. Heck najib suggesting petronas bailout, and anwar, same with the rhetorics. Both not suitable to be PM
----------
1525054556505522176,The entire debate, Anwar was trying to bring the narrative of elites versus commoners, trying to look like people's champions. But then, most of his words are just him questioning every solution from Najib, but none came from his side as a better counter.
----------
1525049881836285952,@teresakok @anwaribrahim Or is Anwar double face? Is Anwar having deal to help Najib to return as he has deal with Zahid? Is Anwar planning to return to Umno via deals with Najib and Zahid? @pakatanharapan_ @MSabu_Official @anthonyloke no one can so stupid like Anwar! All knows the debate helps Najib!
----------
1525047775981084672,@suettyng Najib wanted a to debate Rafizi and Anwar, but only Anwar stupid enough to accept the trap - he was too worried that Rafizi will steal the limelight from him in debating Najib that he is stupid enough to legitimise a convict and enables the convict a national platform!
----------
1525038203731791872,Just started watching the debate between Anwar and Najib on YouTube. I totally agree with Anwar that a forensic audit must be establish in the case of Sapura Energy. I find Najib ambitious argument not convincing enough as Sapura Energy has corporate governance issue.
----------
1525037236844376064,Dalam aku kebuntuan melihat Notion deck project aku, 

aku recall balik debat malam semalam, actually banyak point yang Najib v Anwar compliment each other.

I look debate as to perform your level of understanding and analyze the issues, kedua-dua cover point yang vital.
----------
1525034821210492928,I think an article of metadiscourse analysis on Anwar - Najib debate will be published next year judging by how so many people on Twitter analyse the face off from different angles ü§£
----------
1525028004925124608,Yet to watch Anwar vs Najib debate. One of the topic is Sapura Energy. Became a political topic since PNB owns up to 40% of Sapura after purchasing a worth of RM 4 billion Sapura Energy right issue shares in 2018.
----------
1525023750789337088,Unpopular opinion based on debate.

Najib - Progressive. Eager to look Malaysia maju. Visionary.

Anwar - Transparent. Eager to look Malaysia bebas dari korup. Justice.

If I can choose, I would love to see Najib-Anwar become PM &amp; DPM.
----------
1525012677634199553,Najib didn't win in the debate from my view, but he didn't fail.
On the other hand, Anwar failed because he didn't win in the debate. 

The situation doesn't change, Najib still as the Boss of those naive or corrupted ppl. Anwar didn't get anything through this debate.
----------
1525011277944279040,However the debate is fun to watch, i like the way they talked to each other especially Najib, jelas. For Anwar ada main emotion sikit but still loud and clear speaker üîä
----------
1525010337908461569,Yeah i agreed Anwar didn‚Äôt do his homework for debate, but did he talking bullshit? No. Najib fared better than Anwar in debate but does he deserve the applause? Absolutely no because what he said is totally manipulative plus does not apply with his action.
----------
1525009310329499649,@AdibBusku @muhdrajaei @QiBreezy I know Anwar been challenging Najib for debate for quite sometime but I still do not see the value of it doing it now against a guy who is not even holding any ministerial position in the current govt, some more a convicted criminal. It only makes sense if Najib is still PM.
----------
1525008177598963712,didnt watch the anwar najib debate i just wanna know did they kiss it out by the end of it?
----------
1525007046055436288,@muhdrajaei @zimgodo @QiBreezy Pretty common among non-politically conscious people or perhaps newbies. Anwar has been challenging Najib on a debate for more than 10 yrs kot and Najib dismissed. The difference this time is Najib bring Anwar in

----------
1524999535269117953,How I see the debate. It doesn't matter who presented the better argument -- that was always secondary. Main gain for both Anwar and Najib is that they can now go back to their respective vote bases and claim the win. Anwar can spin tales of leadership, while Najib of relevance.
----------
1524993964390031361,NAJIB v ANWAR DEBATE LAST NIGHT
The fact that we even give space to these two convicts in public sphere it only shows how bankrupt our moral and thinking is.

Oh piss off. If bailing out a company is the solution then let‚Äôs bail out every company in Malaysia so nobody needs to lose their jobs.

1524989990756679680,Kudos to the media organisations who grouped together to host the Najib-Anwar debate.

Kudos to @Karangkraf for hosting Saif-Raf.

Who knew that one could monetise mature political discussions? :)
----------
1524986999362375685,@FreeMsian Personally, I prefer the original Rafizi-Najib debate plan
Anwar made solid points n at times slam dunked on Najib but was still diplomatic, not too aggressive in refuting Najib‚Äôs points

Rafizi however would go for a precision kill
----------
1524982333937397761,@Darvinnnnnnn I didnt see a clear winner whatsoever for the debate, felt like both of them got valid points, with Najib talking about stats and data, whilst Anwar talk about forensic audit. Both are two important things, cant audit without facts.

----------
1524969891681693696,I rewatched the debate between two respectful figures, DS Najib Razak &amp; DS Anwar Ibrahim.

imo, saya tak mampu nak kata siapa-2 menang. Sebab ada yang DS Najib Razak buat argument yang bagus, &amp; DS Anwar Ibrahim pun buat hujah yang bagus.
----------
1524967209629429760,@FreeMsian Anwar is democratic but that not his fault la. Najib and his team know exactly how to play the game into their hand which cater to their based. Still a good debate nonetheless

Would love to see this happens. Esp since what happened in 2017.

Or make it a three-corner debate. Include Anwar in. The more the merrier.

1524959350061924353,though i dont like BN. but i gotta say that Najib totally owned the debate, it is clear that he came well prepared, and Anwar was overconfident

1524950390437203968,@Kendogdoll Thing is, all those are factually correct.

Najib IS better than Anwar in the debate.

Why can't you lot accept that?
----------
1524947311792918528,Two takeaways from the Anwar-Najib LIVE debate :- 

Anwar: Kalau harga gula naik, jangan beli banyak gula (in response to Najib's inflation remark)

Najib: Cash is King, King itu "Rakyat"  

We are so fucked...    

#AnwarVSNajib #CashIsKing
----------
1524946754592194560,Anwar screws up! Anwar gave a convict the national platform to be national leader and hero. Najib just look rational &amp; caring,  he won thousands of voters fr Sapura, PNB &amp; rural areas without a fight!

Anwar lost the debate on top of losing the game! He legitimatises a convict!
----------
1524944793671200768,How to talk like BN 'centrist' 101:
1. Declare that both Najib &amp; Anwar is bad, but Najib better.
2. Say that both has poor points, but Najib is better.
3. Would not want both to be PM, but Najib is better.
4. Thought Anwar is good in debate, but Najib is better.
----------
1524944019683684352,@malaysiakini Anwar gave Najib the national platform and this already a major strategic error. No matter what Najib said, by appearing rationale and caring, Anwar helps Najib to win over voters in Sapura, PNB, GLCs and rural areas to BN! A real stupid move to debate a criminal!

1524943425568907265,Whoever you think won the Anwar v Najib debate, we can safely conclude that Malaysians, as always, are the losers.

1524941139987791873,Baru sempat tengok debate semalam. Najib and Anwar both had their points. But fuck Najib for talking about integrity

He did hide from Anwar this time. @NajibRazak

Why give him relevance ?

He wont go to jail, thats for sure.

----------
1524913812679589888,@adidzulkarnain @suhaeladnan @QiBreezy No such suggestion by Najib. Its Najib's condition, he only agree to debate if Anwar joins. He did not want to debate with Rafizi.

1524912289039536128,@teresakok @anwaribrahim No... Najib personally won coz Anwar gave him a chance to be in national limelight again ignoring the facts that he has been convicted. Najib is craving for publicity and media coverage, Anwar gave it in silver platter.

See the big picture. What is this debate achieve?

1524910529885904896,@teresakok @anwaribrahim Your believe Anwar is the winner. Our believe Najib is the winner. So what..! Who cares about your believe and nobody cares about our believe. Anwar &amp; Najib having a good drinks together after the debate hahahaha...

Najib - All media outlet showing short video of the debate, making him look more visible than Anwar.

Anwar - PR team SUCK BIG TIME, unprepared, tak pikir pun nk get ready sebar, fighting with each other, tweet pointless personal takes of the debate.
----------
1524896789953818627,Baru nampak kenapa Najib sahit cabaran debate dengan Anwar. Dekat media sosial ni ramai dah puji Najib punya argument ni bagus dan relevan. Maknanya apa, maknanya Najib nak bagi soft sign kat rakyat bahawa dia masih relevan dan layak diberikan sokongan.

1524867283490746368,@TheThirdForceMY OF COURSE YOU WOULD SAY THAT SINCE YOU ARE OBVIOUSLY EXTREMELY PREJUDICED AGAINST NAJIB. IF YOU HAD WATCHED THE DEBATE WITH AN OBJECTIVE MIND IT WAS ANWAR WHO 'TENGGELAM TERUS'.

1525676545058017280,Despite everything, on that debate day, Najib Razak clearly lost the debate as voted by Awani‚Äôs Facebook viewers. Almost 75% thought Anwar won it. Then the Awani played dirty. They hid the results.

1525316187982565376,Who wins this debate, IMHO. No one. 
Does this debate brings constructive discourse? No.
Hujah Najib sama dengan hujah-hujah dia bawa masa dia PM dan juga lepas kalah pilihan raya. Anwar is an orator and highlighted issues of corrption and bad governance but less on policy.
----------
1525316184857788417,The issues in Najib/Anwar debate must be taken with a pinch of salt. Whitewashing Najib and overpraising Anwar do little good to the discourse. Najib is a convicted criminal of corruption, and Anwar is a questionable policy maker.

----------
1525049881836285952,@teresakok @anwaribrahim Or is Anwar double face? Is Anwar having deal to help Najib to return as he has deal with Zahid? Is Anwar planning to return to Umno via deals with Najib and Zahid? @pakatanharapan_ @MSabu_Official @anthonyloke no one can so stupid like Anwar! All knows the debate helps Najib!
----------
1525047775981084672,@suettyng Najib wanted a to debate Rafizi and Anwar, but only Anwar stupid enough to accept the trap - he was too worried that Rafizi will steal the limelight from him in debating Najib that he is stupid enough to legitimise a convict and enables the convict a national platform!
----------
1525038203731791872,Just started watching the debate between Anwar and Najib on YouTube. I totally agree with Anwar that a forensic audit must be establish in the case of Sapura Energy. I find Najib ambitious argument not convincing enough as Sapura Energy has corporate governance issue.
----------
1525037236844376064,Dalam aku kebuntuan melihat Notion deck project aku, 

aku recall balik debat malam semalam, actually banyak point yang Najib v Anwar compliment each other.

I look debate as to perform your level of understanding and analyze the issues, kedua-dua cover point yang vital.
----------
1525034821210492928,I think an article of metadiscourse analysis on Anwar - Najib debate will be published next year judging by how so many people on Twitter analyse the face off from different angles ü§£
----------
1525028004925124608,Yet to watch Anwar vs Najib debate. One of the topic is Sapura Energy. Became a political topic since PNB owns up to 40% of Sapura after purchasing a worth of RM 4 billion Sapura Energy right issue shares in 2018.
----------
1525023750789337088,Unpopular opinion based on debate.

Najib - Progressive. Eager to look Malaysia maju. Visionary.

Anwar - Transparent. Eager to look Malaysia bebas dari korup. Justice.

If I can choose, I would love to see Najib-Anwar become PM &amp; DPM.
----------
1525012677634199553,Najib didn't win in the debate from my view, but he didn't fail.
On the other hand, Anwar failed because he didn't win in the debate. 

The situation doesn't change, Najib still as the Boss of those naive or corrupted ppl. Anwar didn't get anything through this debate.
----------
1525011277944279040,However the debate is fun to watch, i like the way they talked to each other especially Najib, jelas. For Anwar ada main emotion sikit but still loud and clear speaker üîä
----------
1525010337908461569,Yeah i agreed Anwar didn‚Äôt do his homework for debate, but did he talking bullshit? No. Najib fared better than Anwar in debate but does he deserve the applause? Absolutely no because what he said is totally manipulative plus does not apply with his action.
----------
1525009310329499649,@AdibBusku @muhdrajaei @QiBreezy I know Anwar been challenging Najib for debate for quite sometime but I still do not see the value of it doing it now against a guy who is not even holding any ministerial position in the current govt, some more a convicted criminal. It only makes sense if Najib is still PM.
----------
1525008177598963712,didnt watch the anwar najib debate i just wanna know did they kiss it out by the end of it?
----------
1525007046055436288,@muhdrajaei @zimgodo @QiBreezy Pretty common among non-politically conscious people or perhaps newbies. Anwar has been challenging Najib on a debate for more than 10 yrs kot and Najib dismissed. The difference this time is Najib bring Anwar in
----------
1525005260145557505,@staronline what he was very likely wanted to say was ideas from my mentor anwar and my good fiend‚Ä¶ oops, err‚Ä¶ my friend najib debate can be turned into national policy
----------
1525004263218642944,@fadzmel @anwaribrahim Najib penuh dengan fakta, Anwar penuh dengan auta Tu je boleh cakap. Tengok balik full debate Dan fahamkan betul¬≤. Paling xboleh blah part soal jawab penonton Tu, geng sendiri soal Anwar..macam dah pakat Dan jawapan pon macam dah ready üòÇ
----------
1525002992902352896,@staronline Why did Anwar debate with Najib and not Ismail?
----------
1524999552482557953,@fmtoday blh guna rekod cd debate anwar vs najib
forensic audit tu je ulang2 ü§£
----------
1524999535269117953,How I see the debate. It doesn't matter who presented the better argument -- that was always secondary. Main gain for both Anwar and Najib is that they can now go back to their respective vote bases and claim the win. Anwar can spin tales of leadership, while Najib of relevance.
----------
1524993964390031361,NAJIB v ANWAR DEBATE LAST NIGHT
The fact that we even give space to these two convicts in public sphere it only shows how bankrupt our moral and thinking is.
----------
1524991801118973957,‚ÄúNajib won the debate because he has a solution and Anwar doesn‚Äôt‚Äù

Oh piss off. If bailing out a company is the solution then let‚Äôs bail out every company in Malaysia so nobody needs to lose their jobs.
----------
1524989990756679680,Kudos to the media organisations who grouped together to host the Najib-Anwar debate.

Kudos to @Karangkraf for hosting Saif-Raf.

Who knew that one could monetise mature political discussions? :)
----------
1524986999362375685,@FreeMsian Personally, I prefer the original Rafizi-Najib debate plan
Anwar made solid points n at times slam dunked on Najib but was still diplomatic, not too aggressive in refuting Najib‚Äôs points

Rafizi however would go for a precision kill
----------
1524982333937397761,@Darvinnnnnnn I didnt see a clear winner whatsoever for the debate, felt like both of them got valid points, with Najib talking about stats and data, whilst Anwar talk about forensic audit. Both are two important things, cant audit without facts.
----------
1524981849591672832,Did y‚Äôall see Najib vs Anwar debate?
----------
1524977341537349632,Whose dumb idea was this Anwar vs Najib debate anyway? I don't see any other convicted criminals doing live tv. Besides other politicians lah.
----------
1524976806817697792,Anwar Ibrahim vs Najib Razak debate last night. 

Who won?
----------
1524976350347796482,Overall the debate between anwar-najib is a great one. Healthy juakla bcs it brought up issues what the ppl need to know. And these 2 individuals are WAY WAY more intelligent than any of these that we have now and everyone knows that.
----------
1524970241612484608,half of me wanting to care about najib vs anwar debate, and half of me malas and already know apa deme akan cakap.

Thank You for Smoking ruins political debate for me tho
----------
1524969891681693696,I rewatched the debate between two respectful figures, DS Najib Razak &amp; DS Anwar Ibrahim.

imo, saya tak mampu nak kata siapa-2 menang. Sebab ada yang DS Najib Razak buat argument yang bagus, &amp; DS Anwar Ibrahim pun buat hujah yang bagus.
----------
1524967209629429760,@FreeMsian Anwar is democratic but that not his fault la. Najib and his team know exactly how to play the game into their hand which cater to their based. Still a good debate nonetheless
----------
1524961542982504448,@zulfxiz tolong rumuskan debate najib dan anwar
----------
1524960596336472066,So, after last night, how about Najib vs Mahathir debate next? 

Would love to see this happens. Esp since what happened in 2017.

Or make it a three-corner debate. Include Anwar in. The more the merrier.
----------
1524959350061924353,though i dont like BN. but i gotta say that Najib totally owned the debate, it is clear that he came well prepared, and Anwar was overconfident
----------
1524954373175975938,Where's Will Smith during the Najib and Anwar debate
----------
1524950390437203968,@Kendogdoll Thing is, all those are factually correct.

Najib IS better than Anwar in the debate.

Why can't you lot accept that?
----------
1524947311792918528,Two takeaways from the Anwar-Najib LIVE debate :- 

Anwar: Kalau harga gula naik, jangan beli banyak gula (in response to Najib's inflation remark)

Najib: Cash is King, King itu "Rakyat"  

We are so fucked...    

#AnwarVSNajib #CashIsKing
----------
1524946754592194560,Anwar screws up! Anwar gave a convict the national platform to be national leader and hero. Najib just look rational &amp; caring,  he won thousands of voters fr Sapura, PNB &amp; rural areas without a fight!

Anwar lost the debate on top of losing the game! He legitimatises a convict!
----------
1524944793671200768,How to talk like BN 'centrist' 101:
1. Declare that both Najib &amp; Anwar is bad, but Najib better.
2. Say that both has poor points, but Najib is better.
3. Would not want both to be PM, but Najib is better.
4. Thought Anwar is good in debate, but Najib is better.
----------
1524944019683684352,@malaysiakini Anwar gave Najib the national platform and this already a major strategic error. No matter what Najib said, by appearing rationale and caring, Anwar helps Najib to win over voters in Sapura, PNB, GLCs and rural areas to BN! A real stupid move to debate a criminal!
----------
1524943425568907265,Whoever you think won the Anwar v Najib debate, we can safely conclude that Malaysians, as always, are the losers.
----------
1524941139987791873,Baru sempat tengok debate semalam. Najib and Anwar both had their points. But fuck Najib for talking about integrity
----------
1524940455766818818,@SenorAmierul @khairul_hafidz Basically org yg ada ilmu, akan ambil both debate points sbgai ideas dan solutions. Yg tkde ilmu ni, asyik ckp psal politik jela. Beza gst sst pun ntah tahu ke tidak. Yg dia tahu, najib penyamun, anwar racist. Ulang¬≤ itu jela smpai mati. Benda baik tknk ambik, bnda jhat je ingat
----------
1524938680938680321,Debate Najib vs Anwar yang senyum Mahathir and Daim. Dia orang yang buat taik, korang yang tukang cuci ü§£
----------
1524931871716478977,Remember the "nothing to hide," debate. Najib ran thru the back door when Tun walked in.
He did hide from Anwar this time. @NajibRazak
----------
1524930350174326790,"so kalau Anwar tak menang, means Najib menang lah?"

bruh Najib didnt debate at all, all he do is campaigning. "ohh we will do this, will do that"

but did you tackle the issue? the economy issue? bribery that are very synonym with Malaysia? lol #DebatPerdana
----------
1524929817627357184,@hanisavanchery Sorry. I just watched the Najib and Anwar debate and I couldn't rein myself in
----------
1524927322641809408,Tujuan debat Najib n Anwar ni adalah utk memberitahu dunia bahawa, Najib is back.

Why would we give a convicted felon a stage to debate on national TV ?

Why give him relevance ?

Silap besar.

He wont go to jail, thats for sure.
----------
1524926378495586304,why is najib and anwar having a debate anyway
----------
1524925356687642624,Xkisah najib ke anwar yg bagus debate malam semalam, my vote bukan untuk perompak negara.  End
----------
1524922975203471362,Interested to see what political commentators say about the Anwar-Najib debate last night. Someone should compile all the commentary into one page for ease of reading!
----------
1524913812679589888,@adidzulkarnain @suhaeladnan @QiBreezy No such suggestion by Najib. Its Najib's condition, he only agree to debate if Anwar joins. He did not want to debate with Rafizi.
----------
1524913712641220608,boring gila debate anwar ngn najib smlm
----------
1524913214021963776,After najib and anwar debate last night, all of sudden people dekat twitter pakar economy, accounting and finance, audit. Cakap pasal forensic accouting konon, published sapura energy annual report pun tak pernah baca, lagi sembang pum pam.
----------
1524912289039536128,@teresakok @anwaribrahim No... Najib personally won coz Anwar gave him a chance to be in national limelight again ignoring the facts that he has been convicted. Najib is craving for publicity and media coverage, Anwar gave it in silver platter.

See the big picture. What is this debate achieve?
----------
1524910529885904896,@teresakok @anwaribrahim Your believe Anwar is the winner. Our believe Najib is the winner. So what..! Who cares about your believe and nobody cares about our believe. Anwar &amp; Najib having a good drinks together after the debate hahahaha...
----------
1524910171079979008,MARKETING
Najib - All media outlet showing short video of the debate, making him look more visible than Anwar.

Anwar - PR team SUCK BIG TIME, unprepared, tak pikir pun nk get ready sebar, fighting with each other, tweet pointless personal takes of the debate.
----------
1524896789953818627,Baru nampak kenapa Najib sahit cabaran debate dengan Anwar. Dekat media sosial ni ramai dah puji Najib punya argument ni bagus dan relevan. Maknanya apa, maknanya Najib nak bagi soft sign kat rakyat bahawa dia masih relevan dan layak diberikan sokongan.
----------
1524891133070876672,The recent debate between Najib-Anwar was expected to reached his targeted audience with his black and white approach. Nothing is new.
----------
1524884879124869120,aduu, aku trlepas live debate Najib  Anwar smlm
----------
1524879983339970560,@fmtoday You guys have already lost the battle against a convict. You guys took this bait to debate. In a way Najib wins public sympathy to keep him free. His oratory skill won over Anwar, driving more support for BN to win GE15. WTF!

----------
1524871941894467584,I watched the Anwar-Najib debate last night. First thing. Why is Najib not locked up in Sungai Buloh already? That is a very important question. Mengapa kita nak layan dia as if he is somebody important? Put him in jail!
----------
1524867283490746368,@TheThirdForceMY OF COURSE YOU WOULD SAY THAT SINCE YOU ARE OBVIOUSLY EXTREMELY PREJUDICED AGAINST NAJIB. IF YOU HAD WATCHED THE DEBATE WITH AN OBJECTIVE MIND IT WAS ANWAR WHO 'TENGGELAM TERUS'.
----------
1524823675127488512,5 years ago I would have been interested in the Najib-Anwar debate. Now it‚Äôs just 2 irrelevant old cocks debating over shit that don‚Äôt matter because the country has gone to the dogs anyway
