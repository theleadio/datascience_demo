Lastly, we ordered a coffee maker that was great for the first day but not refilled after that. We even called down to get more coffee three times and it never came so I finally walked down and bought some at the Starbucks.

We had our ceremony at the Harbor Gazebo, cocktail hour on the waterfront patio, and reception in the Harbor Ballroom. We cannot say enough good things about our day! The entire day my husband and I just kept looking at each other and saying ""this day has been so perfect"" because it was!! We worked with Tabby and from beginning to end she was amazing to work with. She was always very responsive to emails and very organized. She made the entire planning process painless and fun! We worked with Claire to book our room blocks. She was also wonderful to work with, very responsive and professional. The food was outstanding considering the volume of these meals that they make. We had the Sea Bass, the Chicken Fontina and the Vegetable tower. One of our guests told me after the reception that the chicken ""may have been the best thing I have eaten in my entire life"". How cool is that?? I've been to other functions at The Abbey before with different menu options and the food was outstanding then too. Another plus, we had a lot of guests with various nutritional restrictions (gluten free, nut free, dairy free, vegan, celiac's). We had every kind of restriction imaginable it seemed like for some of our guests. Tabby assured us that all of them would be accommodated and none of the restrictions were a problem. Whatever our guests needed, they would make it happen. And they did!There are so many other wonderful things I can say about our day and The Abbey and their staff but there isn't enough room! We can't imagine having our wedding anywhere else. Our guests were blown away by everything the entire weekend. We would recommend The Abbey everyday of the week.

Not to out of the ordinary, but they should specify. (2) More importantly, they have an insane policy that you can't leave your dogs unattended in the room. I have never seen that before and it was a surprise at check-in. I ended up having to check our dogs into a doggie day care in the city because of this policy and frankly wouldn't have chose this hotel if I knew about it. As someone who handles almost all of my booking exclusively through hotels.com, that kind of info should be included.

Located on Main Street, it is within walking distance of the city's major attractions. The hotel is located in a very cool looking historical building. In the late 80's/early 90's, the building was the home of an indoor mall/department store. Since that time, the interior has been gutted and very large rooms put in. I'm not 100 sure, but I'm guessing that the original intent was to create apartment rentals. The hallways are very wide and the rooms are very large. Our room was loft style with the sleeping area in the loft area. On the lower level was a full kitchen and a living/dining area. There were 2 TV's in the room --- one on the lower level and one on the second level. The room was clean and very spacious. The staff at the hotel was friendly and helpful, and the complimentary breakfast was more than adequate. There was a small fitness room on the 5th floor of the hotel. The lobby was large, contemporary looking, and accessible from both the front and back of the hotel. A large parking lot for the hotel was located in the back at a cost (to hotel guests) of 17/night.

Instead you rely on a Single unit that the entire hotel shares, rooms, lobby, everywhere. It's muggy and uncomfortable, hot. 2) Offer the breakfast until 10AM. Why shut it down 9:30AM 3) Relocate. There is absolutely nothing around it but Gabes Bar and Grill. Nothing to walk to, nothing to look at. Nothing. 4) Offer food for guests. If you miss the breakfast, you are out of luck because there is nothing but pretzels to eat the remaining 21 hours after breakfast. 5) Have a manager available to speak with. Stayed 3 days here and never was able to speak with a Manager regarding these issues, when I went to lobby to wait, you realize that every guest is complaining about A/C and understand the front desk run around now.

One night some rude guests were shouting outside of our room at 3am, one phone call and they were gone in five minutes.

There is a children's playground and children's entertainment during the day and in the evening. The only slightly negative thing I would say is that the complex could be a bit more buggy friendly - steps to the pools and beach - could maybe do with a few more slopes. But it's certainly not a deal breaker and we wouldn't hesitate in recommending this place to other families with young children and we would definitely return ourselves. There is planty to do around and about - we did a boat trip on the Starfish, took a bus ride to Cala D'or marina and town centre, visited other beaches along the coast.

The check in clerk stated that they were having problems with dogs so just changed their policy to charge a fee, and she was nice enough to only charge us for one pet - 75.00. Are you kidding We were then put in one of the pet rooms which shared a wall with the elevator and that's exactly what we heard the entire night, the elevator going up and down. We asked to be moved but was told there are only so many pet friendly rooms and there were no other rooms available.

You get a nice buffet breakfast, and can pick up a newspaper to read. There were fresh baked cookies in the afternoon that you could smell in the lobby, but those went quickly. It was located right next to a Hilton Garden Inn which was listed for about 50 bucks more for the price I paid for this hotel. I know the Hilton is a nicer hotel, but unlesss you plan on spending all day in your hotel room, the Hilton is not worth 120+. The Quality Inn is great for a mid/nicer hotel. The price is reasonable (at least for the 75 rate I got), and with the amentities,. was worth it. The hotel smelled nice, except for the hallways which has a slight older smoke smell, but since you only spend a minute walking through them, was not bad, it did not affect the smell of the room. I was on the third floor away from the freeway and noise was not a problem.. Don't waste your money on a more expensive hotel that isn't really THAT much better, unless you like to spend money or have a psychological problem that if you spend 50 bucks more at Hilton, that you're getting your 50 bucks worth more, which you're not.

That said, the fire alarm went off due to a firecracker set off by someone on the upper floors and we all had to evacuate. All of that is procedural and that's fine, but the front desk personnel never left the desk and then when we politely asked if we could go back inside we were met with an employee who was neither willing to explain what was going on nor nice about addressing us. She stood in front of the doors like a guard dog, talking to us like we were all unruly children (though no one was crowding the door, not following protocol, or otherwise giving the staff reason to be that stern). It was very clear that there was no emergency. The hotel was understaffed, which is why I think the staff morale seemed low--it was a holiday weekend, so I wonder about their willingness to be there. I had to literally search for an employee when it was time to check out the front desk personnel was actually in the back washing dishes from breakfast at check-out time. The only thing I really care about in a hotel breakfast is coffee, and they didn't even have real coffee. It was a NesCafe machine, and it wasn't working properly when I was there--very disappointing. Overall, it was a decent stay. My main issue was with staff, but they were dealing with a lot on the holiday weekend and I don't think there was enough staff there. I typically think more highly of La Quinta Inns, but this was just OK.",Holiday weekend fail,Bourbonnais,Katie,FL

We could not fault either the rooms or the view and the staff were all very friendly and helpful with a good standard of English. The downsides were the standard of the car park, which was difficult to negotiate due to the poor maintenance the outside walkways, which were in desperate need of repair as the paving slabs were all loose and most of all the pool, which was difficult to get to for someone with mobility problems and, once there, almost impossible to enter due to lack of anything to hold onto and steps which were so huge that they were only suitable for the extra tall. As I have arthritis in one knee I only used the pool once and could only get out with the help of my husband and brother-in-law. As one of the reasons for choosing this hotel was for the pool, this was disappointing. The inside of the hotel was lovely and we enjoyed the breakfasts and the bar, so our holiday was not totally spoilt. An added bonus was that the ferry to Bellagio,(a beautiful little town)was about 200 metres away outside the Villa Carlotta.

On the third day, the room was cleaned but they did not actually close the door so my room and valuables were left exposed and vulnerable to theft- which is concerning when you realize that you can walk off the street into the underground garage and go into the elevator with no key and no one seeing you and straight to the hotel room floors.

We stood there for atleast 15 minutes even called the front desk from our cell phone. Nothing. Finally, a man walked out of a door right next to the front desk behind the counter. He clearly had been sleeping. I told him that we'd like to check in how long we'd been waiting up front. He was automatically argumentative about how long we'd been waiting. Being tired, after a long trip, I didn't say anything more to him about it. Then, we get to our room. The bathroom floor counters looked like they hadn't been cleaned at all. The only good thing about our stay at this hotel was the mattress on the bed.

As well as a few of the mornings when we went to enjoy the free breakfast, some housekeepers sat and watched what we did and what we ate and how much we took. I was even told that I took ""too many plates"" when I actually needed them since I was bringing food back for my daughter and fiancée. And while we ate I was stared at and talked about.

We wanted to celebrate our anniversary at a nice hotel in Mallorca but it was subpar at best. Hotel is decorated with antique furniture which made the hotel and the rooms smell pretty bad. They also used this very heavy fragrance which made staying at all common areas, such as lobby or bars, quite unbearable. To make things worse, there was a post in the middle of the room which made moving around difficult in a small room. The hotel told us that we had to pay extra in order to change the room as that was the only room available for the price that we paid. One can probably find a much better hotel for the price you pay for this hotel. Service can certainly improve as well. Location is quite awkward as well. It's about 40 minute walk to the city centre and it's not close to the beaches either. Unfortunately, I don't have anything nice to say about this hotel.",Don't deserve 5 star rating!,,Judy,

The basic breakfast was nice for a quick bite before leaving there was yogurt, toast, cinnamon rolls, muffins and even waffles. The only complaint that I have has nothing to do with the motel or staff it was the guests. A bunch of high-school or college age punks were staying there too and created lots of noise and disturbances they behaved like the place was their dorm or frat house.

The building has a different feel to it. What I will say is 1.) amazing bar / restaurant 2.) the nicest people in the world! (I'm from Chicago, so...) 3.) an overall cool experience. We drove down the enchanted highway and stopped at each of the sculptures (I believe the first one off the expressway is in the Guinness book of world records for the largest sculpture of recycled / repurposed scrap). On day 1, we ate at the local pub (there's only 1, so you can't miss it). Once again - friendly folks, great cookin' (and cold beer!). We also toured the many historical buildings there onsite. Wonderfully warm folks - it makes me think how different the world would be if we all treated each other as nicely. So the bottom line - Regent and the Enchanted Castle get two thumbs up.

Breakfast was very good and the lobby provided cold water and coffee all day and evening. The morning paper provided for each guest was a nice perk. Daniel at the front desk was outstanding with his service. Although the hotel was full he remembered our name and gave us excellent advice about attractions and restaurants. Would definitely recommend this hotel,Lovely spot close to Longwood Gardens,,Anne,

The staff is very helpful, knowledgeable and friendly. The room was large and very comfortable. There is a lovely swimming pool outside. The location, half way between Southport and Oak Island, is very convenient and there are plenty of sights, beaches, and things to do in the close surroundings. The neighborhood is safe and there is plenty of parking space. I enjoyed the nice breakfast. If you stay on a busy week-end, the breakfast room gets packed and there is unfortunately not enough space for everyone to be sitting. This is the only downside to this wonderful and very affordable hotel in a great location",Staying at Comfort Suites in Southpourt,,A Traveler,

The food finally arrived at about 1AM. During the wait I called several times and ended up having words with the people at the front desk.
